# Zing
Created a simple, easy to use sign-in page built with HTML and CSS.

Two issues: 
Getting the square to rotate and having a space in-between the square and sign in-menu.

To rotate the square, I gave it a transform: rotate(225deg);

To get the spaces in-between 2 elements, I gave the div a margin-right: 360px;
